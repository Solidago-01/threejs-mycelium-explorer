        <h1>Imagine a hidden mycelial world</h1>
        <p>beneath our feet, where plants and fungi work 
          together in an incredible partnership. 
          Mycorrhizae, the microscopic fungal threads that connect with plant roots, 
          measure in the trillions just beneath the surface. </p>
        <p>
          They help plants access vital nutrients by as much 
          as 100 times more efficiently compared to the plant’s roots alone.

          Mycelium act as protectors, standing between plants 
          and harmful diseases. They strengthen the ground itself, holding 
          everything together in a living armature, improving water retention and 
          helping to prevent up to 80% of soil erosion.</p>

          Through their underground network, these fungi connect plants 
          in a vast, intricate web—one that spans entire natural biomes. 
          This network isn’t just for nutrient sharing; it’s a living safety net. 
          Like a global support system of solidarity and care.</p>

          And as the climate shifts, mycorrhizae could help slow down global 
          warming by sequestering carbon in the soil. They may hold up to 30% 
          of the planet’s carbon storage, helping mitigate the very changes 
          that threaten our world.

          As mycorrhizae are essential to life on Earth,
          they remind us that even the smallest unseen 
          connections hold the power to shape the future of our planet.
